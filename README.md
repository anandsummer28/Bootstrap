# Project Title

Building a webpage using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap3

## Getting Started

After understanding the working of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap from the video tutorials provided by the NIIT Stackroute on youtube, I started building this just to impliment my learning.

### Prerequisites

Better to have sublime-text-editor and google chrome browser
otherwise use any text editor and any web browser

## Deployment

The webpage could be made public but since it has been done for learing process, so I'll avoid that for now.

## Built With

* sublime-text-2 - unregistered version
* Google chrome - Version 63.0.3239.132 (Official Build) (64-bit)
